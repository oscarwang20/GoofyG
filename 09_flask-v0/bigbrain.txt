Q0:
In Java a similar syntax is used to declare an instance of a class.
(ie: Dog a = new Dog())

Q1:
The '/' character is used in the terminal to indicate a path to a 
directory. When changing directory using cd, the '/' character 
becomes useful when the user wants to change directories multiple
times with one command. Alternatively, running `cd /` takes the user
to the root directory of their computer. The '/' character is also 
used in Java to create inline comments.

Q2: 
`print(__name__)` will print the name of the file the command is
being run from into the terminal running it. In this case, it
will be 'app.py'.

After running, this did print to the terminal in the following line:
` * Serving Flask app 'app' (lazy loading)`.

Q3:
This will not appear anywhere because it is being returned from the
function as an output, but Python doesn't have anything to do with 
the output.
######################
After running, "No hablo queso!" appeared on the web server with the 
URL `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, which was indicated by the terminal output
after running `python3 app.py` in the terminal by this line:
` * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)`

Q4: 
This looks like calling a function within a class. The class in this
case is 'Flask', which is being stored in the variable 'app' and the
function is 'run()'.

Question: 
What is the difference between this and localhost:8000?
