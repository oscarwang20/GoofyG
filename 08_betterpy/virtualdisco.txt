K08: Cross Pollination and Virtual Insanity - What is a venv?
2021-09-30

What is?
- venv stands for virtual environemnt, which is a directory that contains a copy of python
- the directory also comes with pip, which allows the user to install python libraries
- in our case, the terminal command we executed created a virtual environment in the myzerohero directory
- the myherozero/bin directory has all the pip and python directories needed to run code and install libraries

Why use?
- virtual environments allow developers to work on their python projects without needing to worry about having the right 
versions of certain libraries
- computers by default use the same directories to store third party libraries (the ones we have to install using pip), which may cause issues when different versions of a certain library is needed for two different projects
- without a virtual environemnt, it becomes cumbersome to delete and redownload the correct version of the dependent library(ies) for each of the two projects

How use? 
- virtual environments can be activated by running `$ source env/bin/activate`
- for our purposes, `env` should be repalced with `myherozero`
- activating the virtual environemnt also changes the $PATH of the terminal (this can be checked by running `$ echo $PATH`)
- to deactivate the virtual environment, run $ deactivate
- now, running `$ echo $PATH` will return a different path than before
