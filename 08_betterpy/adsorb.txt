Differences/Similarities: 
Addition vs Subtraction
- There were two main methods of computing the probability: addition and subtraction 
- addition uses the cumulative sum of each of the probabilities at each occupation
- subtraction subtracts each individual probability from the total until it reaches 0 or less than 0, then chooses whichever occupation caused that change
- some of us defined test functions to see whether or not the probabilities of an occupation matched what was shows in the csv file
- we also noticed that other groups took different approaches to the scaling of the probabilities
- some used integers as percentages while others used floats
- we found out that using random.choices() solves our problems â€” it allows us to pick random objects from a list using weights

Questions: 
- does using multiple decimal places and rounding for the probabilities change the chances of selecting a particular occupation?
