Observations:
- Don't be like ary and put <> in SELECT * FROM
- Typing `PRIMARY KEY` next to a key when creating a table sets the unique primary key that can be used to reference the data
- `csv.DictReader()` puts the information stored in each row of the csv into a dictionary using the keys indicated by the top row
- `DROP TABLE <name> removes a table that has already been created
