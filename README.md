# What is CS?

#### The Encyclopedia Britannica defines Computer science or computing science (CS) as the...

```
Study of computers, their design (architecture), and their uses for 
   computation, data processing, and systems control, 
      including design and development of hardware and software,
          and programming. 
The field encompasses theory, mathematical activities 
   such as design and analysis of algorithms,
      performance studies of systems and their components, 
         and estimation of reliability and availability of systems 
            by probabilistic techniques.
Because computer systems are often too large and complicated 
   for failure or success of a design to be predicted without testing,
      EXPERIMENTATION is built into the development cycle.

#### Wikipedia offers this concise distillation as the opening of its page:

```
CS is the study of the 
   theoretical foundations of computation
      and of practical implementation of this theory 
         in computer systems.
